Driver Drowsiness Detection using SSDMobileNet and OpenCV

I have trained two models using Tensorflow Object detection.
The two models were trained on different datasets taken from the ROBOFLOW universe.

# Active_Fatigue.ipynb (https://colab.research.google.com/github/ReetikRaj20/Driver_Drowsiness_Detection/blob/main/Active_Fatique.ipynb)) 
This had the labels **active** and **fatigue**.
The model achieved an overall accuracy(mAP @ 0.5:0.95) of 89.27%.
