# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection
Driver Drowsiness Detection using SSDMobileNet and OpenCV

I have trained two models using Tensorflow Object detection.
The two models were trained on different datasets taken from the ROBOFLOW universe.

Active_Fatigue.ipynb (https://github.com/ReetikRaj20/Driver_Drowsiness_Detection/blob/main/Active_Fatique.ipynb) had the labels **active** and **fatigue**.
Drowsiness_detection.ipynb (https://github.com/ReetikRaj20/Driver_Drowsiness_Detection/blob/main/Drowsiness_detection.ipynb) had the labels ****awake**** and **drowsy**.
